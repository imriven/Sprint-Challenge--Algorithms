# Analysis of Algorithms

## Exercise I

Give an analysis of the running time of each snippet of
pseudocode with respect to the input size n of each of the following:

```python
a)  a = 0
    while (a < n * n * n):
      a = a + n * n
```


```
b)  sum = 0
    for i in range(n):
      j = 1
      while j < n:
        j *= 2
        sum += 1
```

```
c)  def bunnyEars(bunnies):
      if bunnies == 0:
        return 0

      return 2 + bunnyEars(bunnies-1)
```

## Exercise II

Suppose that you have an n-story building and plenty of eggs. Suppose also that an egg gets broken if it is thrown off floor f or higher, and doesn't get broken if dropped off a floor less than floor f. Devise a strategy to determine the value of f such that the number of dropped + broken eggs is minimized.

Write out your proposed algorithm in plain English or pseudocode AND give the runtime complexity of your solution.


Go to each floor dropping an egg from it as we go. If the egg breaks that's the floor we are looking for. If it doesn't proceed to the next floor and continue dropping. The complexity of this is O(n) - in the worst case because the floor we are looking for could be equal to n(the top floor)

If we didn't care about the number breakages and wanted the least number of trials we could apply a binary search pattern to the problem to achieve an O(log n) solution
