#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - number of operations increases proportionally related to size of input


b) O(nlogn) - output grows slightly faster than proportional (On) but not at a O(n^2) rate


c)O(n) - number of operations increases proportionally related to size of input

## Exercise II



Building - 
We have a building of undisclosed floors
A floor at f or higher will cause fallen eggs to break
A floor lower than f won't cause fallen eggs to break

Eggs - 
We apparently have an unlimited quantity of eggs
Some eggs will fall some won't
Eggs can fall off of floors
Eggs will break if they fall off at floor f and higher
Eggs won't break if they fall off lower than floor f


My solution would be O(n) because as the floor height increases so does the probability that more eggs would fall and break
